#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
#
# The DriverPass project ina brief summary would be a system that the client is trying to create a program that can help individuals become better prepared for on and off road driving tests. THe client whom is DriverPass, specifically the owner's name is Liam and his IT officer is named Ian, have identified a gap not only in the market but in the training required to better prepare students being that there is such a large amount of people who try to complete either of the tests and fail. This program is to help these people become more familiar and prepared for the driving and written test.
#
#What did you do particularly well?
#
# In the project provided I believe some of the things I did particularly well were the structure and clarity in my business documents and my diagrams created for the project this was of course with some trial and error but I do feel I now have a better grasp on the scructure and expectations of a clear and precise business document and I do believe I also was able to describe the system at a non-technical level for stakeholder or specifically the client in this case.
#
#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
#
If there was one part of my work on these documents I could revise I would go back to my presentation created for the client and make a more structured formal presentaion being that these are the clients that are seeing this first hand. I would revise the document and add additional information to the document to be more detailed and precise with the presentation. I would also consider adding costs, possible updated functions, and present best and worse case scenario's for use cases and or development.
#
#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
#
I took note and considered the requirements given by the client first hand. I figured what the purpose of the program was, what was wanted, what was needed and broke these into goals or objectives of the development of the program. This would include capabilites, nonfunctional requirements, and functional requirements. Assumptions and limitations were also considered in this process to have a better understanding of not only what the client wants but to also point out impediments and know the client's timeline of events they plan to move forward with. The user's needs should always be taken into consideration because this is in fact a not only a program but a user interfaced program that will be used by a variety of people from the client to the the client's client. Making the system user friendly will help keep the users happy and continuing to use the system which in turn makes money for our client.
#
#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
#
Now a different perspective of how a software design should be completed is in my head compared to a development where the design process is more of just an outline and then possibly some pseudocode which can eliminate time consumption to an extent but also leaves probablities for mistakes and bugs in a system. This also does not gurantee that the client is happy with the product before development which can lead to repeated worked and wasted man hours on a program which needs to be changed completely or in some cases started over. I will definitely now want to used a business requirement document structure, UML diagrams and continue to use pseudocode but also consider the clients perspective when it comes to technical terms, and nomenclature. Being able to level with the client can go a long way when it come to project design and development because they can understand what is happening and get a better understanding of impediments and set realistic objectives and goals.
